- Password hashing (no plaintext storage)
- One-Time Password (OTP) based multi-factor authentication
- Buffer overflow protection using input validation
- Trapdoor prevention by eliminating hidden backdoors

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: C++
- Compiler: g++
- Version Control: Git and GitHub

## How to Run
